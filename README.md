I undertook a machine learning project to develop a predictive model for estimating the sale prices of heavy construction equipment. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the training of a Random Forest Regressor model. 
I undertook a machine learning project to develop a predictive model for estimating the sale prices of heavy construction equipment. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the training of a Random Forest Regressor model. Key accomplishments and responsibilities in this project include:

Collected and analyzed a comprehensive dataset of sales records, including features like equipment type, model, age, and auction details.

Engineered features to extract valuable information from date columns, such as year, month, day, and day of the week.

Created missing data indicators to handle missing values and ensure data completeness.

Trained a Random Forest Regressor model using scikit-learn to predict sale prices based on the selected features.

Achieved a high level of model accuracy, as evidenced by a low RMSLE score, demonstrating the effectiveness of the predictive model.

Conducted extensive testing and validation of the model, ensuring its robustness and reliability for real-world applications.

Prepared predictions for the test data and exported them to a CSV file suitable for submission to Kaggle competitions.

This project showcased my proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning. It exemplifies my ability to tackle real-world challenges and deliver valuable insights through data analysis and predictive modeling.
